KiCAD Plugin to export netlist as IPC-D-356A

Download the zip or clone the project and put it under the plugins folder for KICAD. 

Documentations says that you can find the path by :
It is opened through    :  Tools → External plugins → Open Plugin Directory
  in the pcb editor.


For KiCAD 7.xx  and windows 10 I opened manually the folder and put it here:

usernamexxxxx\Documents\KiCad\7.0\3rdparty\plugins\

So try to find your folder as mentioned above
